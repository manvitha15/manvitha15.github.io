The Changing Landscape of Business Communication</b></center></p>


<p> The word “Communication” has come from the Latin word “communis”, which means common. Thus, communication signifies sharing of ideas in common. The dictionary meaning of communication is “to convey or exchange information and share ideas”.Communication that was once started through hand signals and hand gestures to express simpler things like hunger, dangers, anger etc has changed into a very complex system where not just the content of communication but also the context of the communication can be understood. But at the same time due to the environmental factors that are involved while growing up in a particular environment also play a vital role in understanding the message provided by the sender.
</p>

<p>Business communication is exchanging information in order to promote an organization's goals, objectives, purpose, and activities, as well as increase profits within the company such as <a href="https://wheel-house.com">WheelHouse Communications</a>. There are many departments in most organisations and every department would need some kind of  communication to reach their goals. The common methods used in business communication are face-to-face, Telephone, Presentations, Letters and VoIP. </p>

<p>VoIP is the latest medium of communication that is rapidly growing in business.Voice over Internet Protocol is a category of hardware and software that enables people to use the Internet as the transmission medium for telephone calls by sending voice data in packets using IP rather than by traditional circuit transmissions of the public switched telephone network (PSTN).Its advantages include modernising of methods of communication which can go in hand with the mechanization of the organization, lesser cost than traditional telephone calls, saves time as people can talk from around the world and also it will help us develop more advanced methods of communication. The disadvantage is that the receiver may not be able to understand the intentions of the message as most of the human communication is through non verbal communication.Besides that, technical problem in a single device could delay the goal of the organization . Moreover, alienation of workers is also a possibility.Some examples of applications that make use of VOIP technology are WhatsApp , Google Phone, Google Phone, Google Phone, Google Group Chat, FaceBook Video Chat and Skype to simply mention a few more common examples that are widely used.</p>

<p>Today, the digital lines between business and personal are changing rapidly.Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is quickly becoming the de facto communication tool for businesses big and small. Available in a variety of formats, including hosted and cloud, VoIP can be tailored to suit the needs of  company such as  <a href="https://www.wheelhouseit.com/voip-phone-service/">WheelHouse Communications</a>. Likewise, as an internet-based technology, the cost advantage of having one phone and data provider is often significant. As VoIP becomes increasingly popular, the consumer demand to make it better does as well. There are four new trends in VoIP technology that are sure to change the industry for the better.
</p>

<p>Though a few companies such as <a href="https://www.wheelhouseit.com/voip-phone-service/">WheelHouse Communications</a>have already begun testing for 5G, widespread use still remains a few years away. However, once it's released, 5G is expected to be about 10 times faster than the current 4G. An increase of this magnitude could have a significant impact on the productivity of any business that uses the internet. It will also improve the quality of VoIP calls by notably reducing or even eliminating jitteriness, data transfer losses and the much-dreaded dropped call. In fact, by 2020, there will be numerous VoIP apps that launch at this higher speed. Likewise, video and web conferencing will also experience a significant leap in quality, with 4K and even 8K video becoming commonplace. With greater reliability, VoIP is likely to become the default method for business communication.By the end of 2017, there will be more than 1 billion VoIP users worldwide. Companies are already looking for ways to overcome the inevitable network strain that will arise from having so many people accessing the VoIP system at the same time. Hosted VoIP providers, including those in the cloud, will have to collaborate with service providers to meet this increase in demand. As other features like faster speed, greater reliability, better security and integration become the standard for VoIP, the service itself will become more mobile-friendly. With VoIP mobile, the possibilities for better business communication on-the-go and international and or remote communication will be virtually unlimited.

<p>CRM Integration:
Many businesses such as 
  rely on VoIP for operational and client relationship management communication. However, technology, in general, is moving toward increased interoperability as the push to accomplish more with less is often the driving force behind new innovations, especially applications. Cloud-based products, including VoIP applications, are poised to take advantage of this trend by using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to connect Client Relationship Management (CRM) tools with VoIP service. Together, these technologies can help enterprise businesses achieve a new level of efficiency and productivity by streamlining previously (and often needlessly) complicated procedures and reducing or even eliminating operational redundancies.</p>

<p>IoT:
The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the technology sectors most anticipated game-changers. In 2015, there were approximately 15.4 billion IoT devices or mechanisms with an on/off switch that connects them to the internet. By 2020, that number is expected to more than double to 30 billion, and in 2025 IoT devices will reach a staggering 75.4 billion. The devices that make up the IoT are already demonstrating their usefulness in the Smart Home applications industry. However, IoT can also be used in conjunction with VoIP to revolutionize the workplace or Smart Office by giving employees the power to remotely book co-working spaces, event spaces or even turn lights and computers on or off at the touch of a button. The number of VoIP Smart Office applications could be endless.
For a lot of businesses, VoIP just makes sense. Likewise, with so many revolutionary advances coming down the pipeline, VoIP is well-positioned to become the new standard for business communication. Companies that stay abreast of these changes are sure to gain a competitive advantage in the near future.</p>

<p>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE:
Artificial intelligence is going to transform customer experiences.A decade ago artificial intelligence was considered science fiction. Now customers are accustomed to virtual assistants such as Apple’s Siri or amazon’s Alexa in their daily life. 2018 saw the unprecedented increase of Artificial Intelligence start-ups and the adoption of Technology across a wide range of industries. AI will also transform call centers in the coming years. It is already in making Call Centers more efficient by quickly answering common questions instead of having customers wait for someone to pick up the phone.Behind the scenes business progressively are adopting AI to predict customer behavior and to provide valuable insights to businesses. In the year of 2019, we can expect that there will be acceptance of bots in the business environment to enhance exponentially.</p>

<p>No one can predict the future of use of VoIP with 100% assurance. It can go in two ways, It can become a dead means of communication or can also become the most used means of communication. With the present scenario of modernisation, increasing population, increasing production , etc we can safely say that VoIP will revolutionise the means of communication  if we could develop VoIP to help the civilisation rather than becoming a threat to security.</p>
